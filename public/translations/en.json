      "Hey there! ðŸ‘‹",
      "I'm a full-stack developer who loves building things that actually work for people. I studied Computer Science and Information Technology, and ever since, Iâ€™ve been diving deep into backend systems, frontend frameworks, and cloud technologies like AWS. These days, I spend most of my time writing clean, scalable code with tools like Java, Spring Boot, React, and Next.js.",
      "Before this life of software, I spent almost three years as a freelance video editor and graphic designer. That creative background stuck with meâ€”it helps me look at software not just as code, but as an experience. I enjoy learning, sharing stories from my journey, and exploring new ways to blend technology and design. If you're up for building something meaningful together, Iâ€™d love to hear from you."
